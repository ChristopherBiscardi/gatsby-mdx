  Gatsby's blog starter now with 100% more MDX
</h1>

Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React, with support for an MDX blog.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out this awesome collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

What's MDX you ask? MDX let's you use JSX in your Markdown, making it even
easier to write blog posts, document your React components, and much more. [Find
out more about MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), and [gatsby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx), the plugin that makes
this blog possible!

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    npx gatsby new my-blog-starter
    https://github.com/hagner/gatsby-starter-blog-mdx
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
