title: Writing Pages in MDX
---

After [installing](/docs/guides/getting-started) the plugin, MDX files
written in `src/pages` will turn into pages. This happens because
gatsby bundles a [page-creator plugin][] by
default. Pages are rendered at a URL that is constructed from the
filesystem path inside `src/pages`. An MDX file at
`src/pages/awesome.mdx` will result in a page being rendered at
`mysite.com/awesome`.

## GraphQL Queries

You can fetch data to use in your MDX file by exporting a `pageQuery`
in the same way you would for a .js page.

```mdx
import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

export const pageQuery = graphl`
  allSitePages {
    TODO: flesh this query out
  }
`

# My Awesome Page

TODO: show prop usage from query
```
