# Getting started

The fastest way to get started with Gatsby+MDX is to use the [MDX
starter](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic). This
allows you to write .mdx files in `src/pages` to create new pages on
your site. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby MDX site.**

1. **Initialize the MDX starter** with the Gatsby CLI

    ```sh
    npx gatsby new my-mdx-starter https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic
    ```

1. **Run the dev server** by changing directory to the scaffolded site and install dependencies

    ```sh
    cd my-mdx-starter/
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1. **Open the site** running at http://localhost:8000!

1. **Update the MDX content** by opening the `my-mdx-starter` directory
    in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.mdx`.
    Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Add MDX to an existing Gatsby site

If you already have a Gatsby site that you'd like to add MDX to, you
can follow these steps:

1. **Add `gatsby-mdx`** and MDX as dependencies

    ```sh
    yarn add gatsby-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
    ```

1. **Update your `gatsby-config.js`** to use the `gatsby-mdx` plugin

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        // ....
        `gatsby-mdx`
      ]
    }
    ```

1. **Restart `gatsby develop`** and add an `.mdx` page to `src/pages`
