# Gatsby Remark Plugins

This config option is used for compatibility with a set of plugins
many people [use with
remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/?=gatsby-remark-) that
require the gatsby environment to function properly. In some cases,
like
[gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/?=gatsby-remark-),
it makes more sense to use a library like
[prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)
to render codeblocks using a [React
component](/api-reference/mdx-provider). In other cases, like
[gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/?=gatsby-remark-),
the interaction with the Gatsby APIs is well deserved because the
images can be optimized by Gatsby and you should continue using it.

# Usage

```js
gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
    options: {
      // It's important to specify the maxWidth (in pixels) of
      // the content container as this plugin uses this as the
      // base for generating different widths of each image.
      maxWidth: 590
    }
  }
];
```
